# Community Hawkes Independent Pairs (CHIP) Network Model



This repo is the Python implementation of the CHIP network model as part of the supplementary material for the paper 
submitted to NeurIPS2020, titled "Scalable and Consistent Estimation in Continuous-time Networks of Relational Events".

All datasets used in this repo are either available in the `storage/datasets` directory or 
will be automatically downloaded by the preprocessing script.

The code was run by Python 3.6.8.
