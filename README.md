# Community Hawkes Independent Pairs (CHIP) Network Model



This repo includes the Python implementation of the CHIP network model 
introduced in the paper [Consistent Community Detection in Continuous-Time Networks of Relational Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06940),
as well as the code to replicate all experiments in the aforementioned paper.

All datasets used in this repo are either available in the `storage/datasets` directory or will be automatically downloaded by the preprocessing script.

The code was run by Python 3.6.8.
